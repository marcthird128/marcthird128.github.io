            Slimefun is a plugin for Minecraft. It modifies the game
            to add hundreds of new items like jetpacks and steel armor.
            You don't have to install any mods, just connect to a Slimefun
            server.

            <p>
                The Slimefun Guide is how you use Slimefun. It's a book that
                when right-clicked opens a GUI with sections for all the
                items in Slimefun. You should spawn with a guide in your
                inventory but if you don't, type <code onclick="select(this)">/sf guide</code> in the chat
                to get one. You can also type <code onclick="select(this)">/sf open_guide</code> to open the
                guide without having a book.
            </p>

            <h4>Unlocking Items</h4>
            <p>
                Slimefun items have to be unlocked to be made or used. In
                the slimefun guide, most of the items will be locked by
                default. To unlock them, just click on it. This will use
                up the required number of XP levels and it will be unlocked.
            </p>

            <h4>Item Recipes</h4>
            <p>
                When you unlocked an item, clicking on it again will take you to
                the recipe for that item. This recipe shows you how to make the
                item.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the left it shows what you build it in. It could say
                Multiblock, which means build the diagram in Minecraft, or it
                could show which Slimefun item you use to make it.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the middle is the recipe - its like a crafting recipe. It's
                either what you build in the world or how you place the items
                in the machine's dispenser.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the right is what you get from making it. Pay attention to
                the number of items here as if there's more than you don't need
                as many resources.

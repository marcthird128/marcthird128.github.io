# This is a notes file about the website

So, the dropdown menu with some icons was recently added. And the problem is that it doesn't blur the background. Applying `backdrop-filter: blur(10px)` to its CSS just doesn't work. Also, it should be above all other elements on the page, but `z-index` seems to not work too for some reason...

To-Do List:
- [ ] Finish the "SF Help" page
- [ ] Add a server lore/history page
